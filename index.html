        <div class="subheading mb-5">Pre-BusinessðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">Hello, my name is Ryan Hye and I am attending the University of California, Riverside. I am currently in my first year and majoring in Pre-Business, which then goes to the School of Business. From then, I'll be applying for the Accounting concentration because that suits me more. Since I am only in my first year attending this university, I am still particularly new to everything that surrounds me. I am still getting used to the dormitory lives and getting used to the diverse campus that the university offers me. As of now, I am currently taking a CS 8 course to learn about the basics of computer science and also taking macroeconomics because I believe this course will teach me a lot about the current economy state and how it functions. Although as of now, this experience has been cut short because of a rising pandemic that has occurred worldwide. Because of this pandemic, I went back home and took classes online because the university deemed it necessary to push to online courses. I generally miss the campus life and the dormitory life but you just have to face the reality. 
<br><br>

        My hobbies include playing video games, basketball, and working on spreadsheets. Video games are a great way to spend your time with your friends online. You can also use it to meet new friends on the internet and form connections with them. Playing games together makes the games more fun to play so I generally do this very often when Iâ€™m not busy with school work and house work. Before the pandemic, I used to play basketball a lot. I would play with my brother very often because I generally like the feeling of making in hoops as I throw the ball. I have played it since I was little and I am still fascinated by the sport itself. Every now and then, I would go outside just to shoot a couple of hoops for fun and then go on with my day. I believe that it helps ease the tone a little bit when youâ€™re stressed out over school work or grades. I also work on spreadsheets on my own time because since Iâ€™m choosing to be an accountant as I grow up, I want to learn more about this software. Microsoft Excel still has a lot of features that I donâ€™t know of so I work on spreadsheets about my game statistics, my life statistics, and etc. I like creating charts because they are so compact and easy to look at. I enjoy inputting formulas into spreadsheets and seeing the magic of it working. It helps me by wasting time as I am working on perfecting a spreadsheet thatâ€™ll only benefit me and no one else. 
<br><br>

        What I want to be when I grow up is to be an accountant because I enjoy keeping things on tracks and using computer software to make it easier to look at. I wanted to be an accountant when I took an introduction to accounting course in my high school. I was doing so well on the assignments that I believe I should be using this kind of skill in a real life job, so I chose to be an accountant when I grow up. I learned the basics of Excel in this course and learned how to customize it to make it look more presentable to others. I am also using Excel as a hobby because I want to learn more about this software and be able to do anything I want by just inputting a simple command. With this knowledge, I can create stylish spreadsheets and make it look very compact as possible and also make it completely understandable as well. I am taking business classes in my college right now and will be taking accounting courses as soon as I hit the School of Business.
